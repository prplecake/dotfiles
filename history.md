## History 

I used [henrik's dotfiles](https://github.com/henrik/dotfiles) as a
guide for creating my own system. Then I decided that system wasn't
working for me. So in May 2019, I rewrote most of it. The new system is
closer to [holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles). I
took some organizational tips from his repository as well as modeled my
shell script after theirs. A more install script has been inspired by
[Charles Gould](https://git.sr.ht/~crg/config).
